# Getting Started

## Data Sourcing
After downloading  the dataset file in Excel format, we start by creating 3 new sheets:
1.	"Working" sheet: a copy of the original data where we can perform all the cleaning procedures, without worrying about transforming or even losing our raw table.
2.	"Pivot Calculation" sheet: where we create Pivot Tables according to our need.
3.	"Dashboard" sheet: where we insert the visualizations of our analysis as well as the slicers to filter our data.

## Data Cleaning and Transformation
This stage began with getting to know the dataset and checking for any data quality issues.
1.	Removing duplicates, unwanted cells and irrelevant columns.
2.	Replacing values with more meaningful entries  using FIND and REPLACE functions.
3.	Creating a conditional column based on the "Make" column to make out 4 different Make  brackets like luxury, premium, mid-range, economy class using NESTED IF function.

## Data Analysis
Five pivot tables were created to summarise the data and help identify trends in the dataset focusing on relationship between car price  and other factors such as Mileage, horse_power, rpm, No-of_engine, No_of_cylinder etc.

## Below is a snippet of the pivot tables in Excel.

## Data Visualization
Finally, two dashboards was created by inserting and  customizing the pivot charts of corresponding  pivot table.
For user friendly and interactive experience  3 "Slicers" were added for each charts.

Below is a snippet of the final dashboard in Excel.
