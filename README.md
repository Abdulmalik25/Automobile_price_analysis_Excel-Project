# Getting Started

## Data Sourcing
After downloading  the dataset file in Excel format, we start by creating 3 new sheets:
1.	"Working" sheet: a copy of the original data where we can perform all the cleaning procedures, without worrying about transforming or even losing our raw table.
2.	"Pivot Calculation" sheet: where we create Pivot Tables according to our need.
3.	"Dashboard" sheet: where we insert the visualizations of our analysis as well as the slicers to filter our data.

## Data Cleaning and Transformation
This stage began with getting to know the dataset and checking for any data quality issues.
1.	Removing duplicates, unwanted cells and irrelevant columns.
2.	Replacing values with more meaningful entries  using FIND and REPLACE functions.
3.	Creating a conditional column based on the "Make" column to make out 4 different Make  brackets like luxury, premium, mid-range, economy class using NESTED IF function.

## Data Analysis
Five pivot tables were created to summarise the data and help identify trends in the dataset focusing on relationship between car price  and other factors such as Mileage, horse_power, rpm, No-of_engine, No_of_cylinder etc.

## Below is a snippet of the pivot tables in Excel.

## Data Visualization
Finally, two dashboards was created by inserting and  customizing the pivot charts of corresponding  pivot table.
For user friendly and interactive experience  3 "Slicers" were added for each charts.

Below is a snippet of the final dashboard in Excel.

## Key Insights:

- Car Price and Number of Doors: Luxury cars with fewer doors command higher prices, while mainstream models with four doors are priced more competitively. This trend highlights the association between car type and pricing strategy.

- Fuel Type and Price: Diesel cars tend to have higher price tags compared to their gasoline counterparts. This observation underscores the impact of fuel efficiency and market demand on pricing decisions.

- Mileage and Price: As expected, car prices decrease with mileage, reflecting the trade-off between performance and depreciation. Higher horsepower is often associated with higher prices, further influencing the pricing dynamics based on performance metrics.

- Brand Analysis: Toyota emerges as the dominant brand in the used car market, followed closely by Nissan, known for offering budget-friendly options. This brand preference sheds light on consumer preferences and brand loyalty in the automotive industry.

- Horsepower and Price: The correlation between horsepower and price is evident, with higher horsepower translating to higher price points. This relationship underscores the premium associated with increased performance capabilities.

- Market Trends: Analyzing market trends can reveal valuable insights into consumer behavior and preferences, guiding strategic decisions for pricing and product positioning in the competitive automotive landscape.

- Future Opportunities: Identifying emerging trends such as the growing demand for electric vehicles or the rise of autonomous technology can provide valuable opportunities for innovation and market differentiation in the automotive industry.
